# Functional Footwear

Footwear is one of the more important investments with any type of physical activity.  I have several pieces of footwear with very specific purposes and intentions.  I personally train for strength and endurance. I live in the flat Prairie of the Upper Midwest and work in the higher elevations of Norther New Mexico.  I have the opportunity to move from 1700 feet about sea level to 7800 feet with consistency.  This allows me to train hard at elevation and continue at home base.  It is a nice rotation for my body.

My workouts are mostly functional fitness routines with sprints, Olympic lifts with heavier weight and distance runs/ruck.  I have footwear that I have invested in that are adaptable for a number of activities.  Fashion is not something that I put a lot of emphasis on, but most of my footwear are wearable about anywhere.  I stress the word Investment also; I am a believer in spending money on quality items that are built to last.  In the past, I have opted for the less expensive route only to have to replace it again a short time later.  A person spends more money in the long run.

Here is a quick account of what I have with me now, in both a daily wear and test option:

## 1. [Solomon XA Pro 3D Ultra 2 Trail Running Shoe](https://www.rei.com/product/807599/salomon-xa-pro-3d-ultra-2-trail-running-shoes-mens)

This is my go-to shoe for everything that I do.  It does not matter if I am driving cross-country, running a 10K or walking to the post office, I wear these the most.  I am a firm believer in a state of constant readiness.  To me, this means being prepared to defend myself and/or others around me regardless of where I am or what I am doing.  I also live by a 3-Step Resolution of the Threat.

1.	We leave the situation
2.	The Threat leaves the situation
3.	We are forced to respond to the Threat

I am a Combat Veteran who sought violence during my time in Iraq.  Being part of the invading force and having no frame of reference in combat operations in that region, having an aggressive posture was necessary to survival.  Since then, Life has changed and my perspective along with it.  A non-aggressive, non- “Tactical” posture is the correct way to live.  Respect should be shown to everyone, until they no longer deserve it.  We should be prepared at all times to defend what is ours.

Since the 1st Resolution to the Threat is to leave the situation, my first thought when getting dressed for the day is, “How long could I run in these clothes?”  The answer depends largely on my footwear and the Solomon 3D Ultra 2 Trail Shoes are proven.  I run extensively for work, teaching our Defensive Pistol, Rifle and Shotgun Courses.  I run extensively for fun and programming.  My life revolves around a strong state of readiness and these shoes are a key part of that.  

So far I am over a year of constant use with no failure with these shoes.  I have a couple of thousand miles on them in a multitude of environments on two continents.  Highly recommended.

## 2. [Lowa Trekker:](https://www.lowaboots.com/mens/trekking/trekker?color=Dark%20Brown)

I have had these boots for almost 3 years and worn them extensively in the San de Cristo Mountains at the foothills of the Rockies.  The reason I purchased these in the first place were to replace a pair of Danner Combat Hikers that fell apart on me in about six weeks.  I am hard on clothing because of the type of work I do and the environment I do them in, but six weeks was very disappointing for these boots.  Hence, I do not wear Danners anymore.  

The Lowa Trekker took a short time to break in and were easy to take care of.  I use a pair of green Superfeet insoles and have thousands of miles on these with no discomfort.  The only wear, outside of the natural degradation of the sole, is the rubber edging around the natural crease in the front foot area.  There is a lot of bending in that area, just from normal walking and the rubber had began to tear.  I have a high maintenance schedule with my boots engrained in me from the Army, so I do not let me boots dry out and am diligent about oiling.  After three years of constant use, these boots are as comfortable as ever.

## 3. [UnderArmour Valsetz RTS Tactical:](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/ua-valsetz-stealth/pid1250234-220)

These boots are not my first choice in anything that I do, but not because they are a bad boot.  They just do not fit in with my lifestyle.  I received these boots before a 12 day Precision Shooting Course Series at the Whittington U, working in the mountainous Backcountry Training Area.  A normal day while I am instructing is up at 0450hrs, pick up students at 0600hrs, shoot in the backcountry until 1500-1600hrs (weather dependent,) reset the range for the next day and then workout.  Workouts range from run/rucks to flipping logs and tires.  Most of the time, I carry a change of clothes with me but train in the same footwear that I wear on the range.  

In testing these UnderArmour Valsetz, they were extremely comfortable from the beginning as far as how the boot fit my foot.  The cushioning in the insole is phenomenal, although it began to work against me as time moved on in them.  I have several spots in my body that I have to be very careful of, lower back and knees being two very important ones.  I have to have support otherwise I feel it in my knees and back.  After a few days of wearing these on the range and working out in them, it started to take a toll on my body.

Finally, about 9 days into courses in the Backcountry, the boots started to come apart where the sole met the upper at the forefoot area.  Again, I would not say that these boots are garbage; just that I live in a more austere lifestyle than what they are designed for.  I would suggest a boot like this for light to medium duty in more of an urban setting vs. a rugged wilderness one.

## 4. [Red Wing Heritage Iron Rangers:](http://www.redwingheritage.com/us/USD/product/footwear/6-inch-boots/6-amber-8111-08111;pgid=y.9oQI7RkfNSRpvKp1vtKKN10000c4kG0Q8B;sid=VFAIt3dHOBEItyG6Bd9Y02Prz2cRoOxwTUeTgG5Q)

These are my latest purchase, as my Lowa’s needed resoling and a new rubber edging.  I started to look at boots differently after my run in with the Danner’s and the past 3 years with the Lowa Trekkers.  My issue boots were what I wore all of the time in the Army and they were very broke in and comfortable.  I took good care of them and would have continued to resole them because they fit like part of my foot.  This is the same concept in looking at the Iron Rangers.  

They came with a flat cork sole with a heel and I have not had that ever (I am not a cowboy boot guy.)  But I am around a lot of them, both at home and in New Mexico.  People seem to get around just fine with a flat sole, outside of ice.  Most of the areas that I work in, when wet only collect mud in the tread of my boots anyways – kind of like having aggressive tread on a tire that just spins because it is full of mud.  This will be one test this training season, to see how mobility is truly affected with a flat sole. 
 
The Iron Rangers are a simple leather boot that is well constructed.  With good care, they should last a long time – and we will see if this is the case.  These boots have a Goodyear Welt and I will be resoling them as many times as necessary, probably with a lug sole next time too.

## Conclusion

Functionality is the core of our lives.  The items we purchase should fit our lifestyles and last.  There is no reason to have to buy a new pair of footwear for every season.  There is a concept called Planned Obsolescence that applies an artificial lifespan to a product during the manufacturing process.  Unfortunately, this is part of just about every article of clothing now, outside of the niche market or specific use items.  But if you do your research and take care of your investments, your footwear will take good care of you and last for years to come.
