# Functional Footwear

Footwear is one of the more important investments with any type of physical activity.  I have several pieces of footwear for very specific purposes and intentions.  I personally train for strength and endurance. Living in the flat Prairie of the Upper Midwest and working in the higher elevations of Norther New Mexico.  I have the opportunity to move from 1700 feet about sea level to 7800 feet with consistency.  This allows me to train hard at elevation and continue back at home base.  This is a nice rotation for my body.

My workouts are mostly functional fitness routines with sprints, Olympic lifts with heavier weight and distance runs/ruck.  I have footwear that are adaptable for a number of activities.  Fashion is not something that I put a lot of emphasis on, but most of my footwear are wearable about anywhere.  I invest in my feet, knees and back with what I wear and train in.  I am a believer in spending money on quality items that are built to last.  In the past, I have opted for the less expensive route only to have to replace it again a short time later, spending more money in the long run.

Here is a quick account of what I have with me now, in both a daily wear and test option:

## 1. [Solomon XA Pro 3D Ultra 2 Trail Running Shoe](https://www.rei.com/product/807599/salomon-xa-pro-3d-ultra-2-trail-running-shoes-mens)

This is my go-to shoe for everything that I do.  It does not matter if I am driving cross-country, running a 10K or walking to the post office, I wear these the most.  They provide great stability and support to my arches.  Traction has never been an issue, especially running on hard packed snow and ice.

I am a firm believer in a state of constant readiness.  To me, this means being prepared to defend myself and/or others around me regardless of where I am or what I am doing.  I also live by a 3-Step Resolution of the Threat.

1.	We leave the situation
2.	The Threat leaves the situation
3.	We are forced to respond to the Threat

Since the 1st Resolution to the Threat is to leave the situation, my first thought when getting dressed for the day is, “How long could I run in these clothes?”  The answer depends largely on my footwear and the Solomon 3D Ultra 2 Trail Shoes are proven.  I run extensively for work, teaching our Defensive Pistol, Rifle and Shotgun Courses, while logging miles for fun and programming.  My life revolves around a strong state of readiness and these shoes are a key part of that.  

So far I am over a year of constant use with no failure with these shoes.  I have a couple of thousand miles on them in a multitude of environments on two continents.  Highly recommended.

## 2. [Lowa Trekker:](https://www.lowaboots.com/mens/trekking/trekker?color=Dark%20Brown)

I have had these boots for almost 3 years and worn them extensively in the Sange de Cristo Mountains at the foothills of the Rockies.  The reason I purchased these in the first place were to replace a pair of Danner Combat Hikers that fell apart on me in about six weeks.  I am hard on clothing because of the type of work I do and the environment I do them in, but six weeks was very disappointing for these boots.  Hence, I do not buy Danners anymore.  

The Lowa Trekker took a short time to break in and were easy to take care of.  I use a pair of green Superfeet insoles and have thousands of miles on these with no discomfort.  The only wear, outside of the natural degradation of the sole, is the rubber edging around the natural crease in the front foot area.  There is a lot of bending in that area, just from normal walking and the rubber had began to tear.  I have a high maintenance schedule with my boots engrained in me from the Army, so I do not let me boots dry out and am diligent about oiling.  After three years of constant use, these boots are as comfortable as ever.

## 3. [UnderArmour Valsetz RTS Tactical:](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/ua-valsetz-stealth/pid1250234-220)

These boots are not my first choice in anything that I do, but not because they are a bad boot.  They just do not fit in with my lifestyle.  I received these boots before a 12 day Precision Shooting Course Series at the Whittington U, working in the mountainous Backcountry Training Area.  A normal day while I am instructing is up at 0450hrs, pick up students at 0600hrs, shoot in the backcountry until 1500-1600hrs (weather dependent,) reset the range for the next day and then workout.  Workouts range from run/rucks to flipping logs and tires.  Most of the time, I carry a change of clothes with me but train in the same footwear that I wear on the range.  

In testing these UnderArmour Valsetz, they were extremely comfortable from the beginning.  The cushioning in the insole is phenomenal, although it began to work against me as time moved on in them.  I have several spots in my body that I have to be very careful of, lower back and knees being two big ones.  I have to have support otherwise I feel it in my knees and back.  After a few days of wearing these on the range and working out in them, it started to take a toll on my body.

Finally, about 9 days into courses in the Backcountry, the boots started to come apart where the sole met the upper at the forefoot area.  Again, I would not say that these boots are garbage; just that I live a more austere lifestyle than what they are designed for.  I would suggest a boot like this for light to medium duty in more of an urban setting vs. a rugged wilderness one.

## 4. [Red Wing Heritage Iron Rangers:](http://www.redwingheritage.com/us/USD/product/footwear/6-inch-boots/6-amber-8111-08111;pgid=y.9oQI7RkfNSRpvKp1vtKKN10000c4kG0Q8B;sid=VFAIt3dHOBEItyG6Bd9Y02Prz2cRoOxwTUeTgG5Q)

These are my latest purchase, as my Lowa’s needed resoling and a new rubber edging.  I started to look at boots differently after my run in with the Danner’s and the past 3 years with the Lowa Trekkers.  My issue boots were what I wore all of the time in the Army and they were very broke in and comfortable.  I took good care of them and would have continued to resole them because they fit like part of my foot.  This is the same concept with the Iron Rangers.  

They came with a flat cork sole with a heel and I have not had that ever (I am not a cowboy boot guy.)  But I am around a lot of them, both at home and in New Mexico and people seem to get around just fine with a flat sole, outside of ice.  Most of the areas that I work in, when wet only collect mud in the tread of my boots anyways – kind of like having aggressive tread on a tire that just spins because it is full of mud.  This will be one test this training season, to see how mobility is truly affected with a flat sole. 
 
The Iron Rangers are a simple leather boot that is well constructed.  With good care, they should last a long time – and we will see if this is the case.  These boots have a Goodyear Welt and I will be resoling them as many times as necessary, probably with a lug sole next time too.  These boots run large too.  I went down a half a size with plenty of space left on the inside.  I did put a pair of orange Superfeet insoles in these boots and they took up the majority of that space, making these boots extremely well fitting.  I am looking forward to the training season in these boots.  

## Conclusion

Functionality is the core of our lives.  The items we purchase should fit our lifestyles and last.  There is no reason to have to buy a new pair of footwear for every season.  There is a concept called Planned Obsolescence that applies an artificial lifespan to a product during the manufacturing process.  Unfortunately, this is part of just about every article of clothing now, but if you do your research and take care of your investments, your footwear will take good care of you and last for years to come.
