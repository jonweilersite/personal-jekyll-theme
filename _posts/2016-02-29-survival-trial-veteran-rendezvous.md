I created Survival Trial in 2011 as a combination adventure race and shooting competition.  I did not really have a clear direction or voice to the event itself, I just wanted to see if it could be done.  I also was not planning on a future for Survival Trial, but it has since taken on a life of its own.  

I am very grateful for Survival Trial.  It has introduced me to people from every walk of life, all with extraordinary ability to endure – and endure well.  Survival Trial has given me opportunity to learn new things and try fresh concepts that go outside of the “norm” in my industry.  It has also given me an opportunity to provide a meeting place for Military Veterans.

This year we are going into the 12th and 13th Survival Trial and are evolving again.  This year we are incorporating a stronger narrative in the Arenas that revolve around the headlines we see in the News.  This gives more depth to the reason why Competitors are moving and responding in the Arenas, but it also gives purpose for preparation.  Survival Trial is designed around our Everyday.  To prepare for Survival Trial is to prepare for Life.

This is what makes Survival Trial appealing to Military Combat Veterans.  Most of our Lives revolve around preparation, based on our previous combat experience.  My Life does.  I keep myself as physically fit as possible.  I test myself mentally, in learning new skills and capabilities to help progress my overall effectiveness.  I focus on creating a strong and stable emotional environment in my life.  All of these things in pursuit of a complete Life.

Survival Trial is a proving ground of sorts.  A person can be extremely physically fit, but fall apart after 18 hours of exhaustion.  Many times, we get into the Survival Trial Arena and realize that our Land Navigation Skills are very rusty and then nothing goes as planned.  This is appealing to most Veterans, this challenge in being in a difficult situation and having to find the best way out.  

Survival Trial is an eye opener to all of us.  It gives the opportunity to test our preparation.

I will continue to learn new things that I can bring to the Survival Trial Arenas and explore new concepts to help it to become more.  Our world is constantly changing and doing so at an alarming pace, we have to change with it or we will not *Survive.*  This is part of the challenge of Survival Trial, being able to accept the Unknown and adapt to Change.  This goes directly against most of our internal programming.

But it is the best part of it for me.  Survival Trial forces me out of my comfort zone.
