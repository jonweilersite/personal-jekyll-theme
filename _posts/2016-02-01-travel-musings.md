Today is January 31, 2016, the first month into the year.  The mere fact that January is over just blows my mind.  I got home last night from an 18 hour intercontinental flight, a 5 hour domestic flight and a 3.5 hour drive from the airport last night, just in time for “family movie night,” where we watched “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” (or at least 1.5 hours of it before I fell asleep…) When I finally fell asleep last night, the clock said 10:30 (pm).  When I woke up this morning it said 11:30 (am).

I can count on one hand the times that I have slept like this before, 13 hours of sleep.  To top it off, all three of my children were sick last night and not the “easy sick.”  We are talking puking and diarrhea, which my wonderful wife diligently handled with love and care for our children.  I had no idea these things were happening until I stumbled out to find the coffee pot, just before lunch.
I love to travel, I always have.  When I was a young man, I made a list of “things to do before I die.”  Most of those things included travelling to places that I read about in World History Class with my favorite and most influential high school teacher, or the dangerous things that I felt drawn to, even though I was scared of the thought of actually doing them.  

But I did them anyways.  

If there has been one constant in my Life, it has been Fear.  Mostly the Fear of the Unknown.  I have stood on the very edge of the ramp of a C130 with an MC4 Parachute on my back and a very heavy rucksack attached to my front, watching the patchwork of land below, waiting for the Jumpmaster to give me the green light to fall and end the agony of standing there, waiting.  I have stepped out of every Army aircraft (minus a C5) in either Military Free Fall (MFF), Static Line, Fast Rope Insertion/Extraction System (FRIES), Special Purpose Insertion/Extraction System (SPIES) or Rappelling, all with a sense of foreboding and excitement.  Mostly foreboding…

## On Combat:  

I have walked the streets of Baghdad with just my Shooter, with little or no support in active combat in Iraq, looking for a suitable place to put in our Sniper Observation Position.  I have been in more direct fire engagements than precision shooting engagements, even though that was my duty position during that time.  I have seen the barrel of a rifle train right on to my position; looked right at it and froze as my friend saved my life.  I have experienced things with men that shaped me to who I am today; whom I still think about on a daily basis, the strength of their character.
  
Most of which I understand more of now, as I get older and the Good Lord opens my eyes to the things in Life around me.  I left the military at a true crossroads:  One that could have/would have been and the other Unknown.  I chose the Unknown and have not looked back.

I have traveled the world since then, living with those whom I were fortunate enough to meet along the way, experiencing Life through the eyes of those giving it.  I have met most of my “Bucket List,” but that is OK.  It has forced me to create a larger list, one broader in scope and not limited to just myself anymore.

In the meantime, I have met the woman I was supposed to be with, fathered three beautiful children and have been fortunate to be part of a supportive and caring small community in the Upper Midwest.  I could not imagine a better Life and this is the truth.

So where to go from here…
